  1. What this extension does
  Email Sorter AI lets you:
  
  See AI summaries & labels when you hover over Gmail threads.
  
  Get suggested replies when you open and click “Reply”.
  
  
  2. Data we access
  Via Gmail API scopes you approve, we may read:
  
  Email metadata: subject, sender (“From”), dates, thread/message IDs.
  
  Email content: body text of the messages you hover/open (for summarization and reply suggestions).
  
  We do not access your password or other Google account data.
  
  3. How we use your data
  We use your email text solely to:
  
  Classify the message into Recruiters / Personal / Social Media.
  
  Generate short summaries for display in the tooltip.
  
  Generate a suggested reply when you click “Reply”.
  
  
  4. Where processing happens
  Your browser sends the selected email text (subject/body) and IDs to our backend at https://email-ai-backend-bkg9.onrender.com.
  
  The backend may send that text to OpenAI’s API to produce embeddings, summaries, or reply drafts.
  
  We may store cached summaries/drafts keyed by thread ID to reduce costs and latency.
  
  5. Data retention & deletion
  Temporary cache: We cache summaries/replies on our server for up to 30 days and then purge.
  
  
  We do not sell or rent your data.
  
  You can delete cached data anytime (see “Data Deletion” below).
  
  6. Sharing & third parties
  We share data only with:
  
  OpenAI (LLM provider) to generate summaries/replies. Data is sent over HTTPS and used per OpenAI’s API terms.
  We do not otherwise share, sell, or disclose your data to advertisers or data brokers.
  
  7. Your choices & controls
  You can revoke Gmail access at any time at: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
  
  Disable or uninstall the extension to stop all processing.
  
  Use the in‑extension “Clear AI” option to remove a draft before sending.
  
  Contact us to delete any server‑side cached data (see below).
  
  8. Security
  We use HTTPS for all network calls. API keys and tokens are stored server‑side as environment variables, not in the extension code.
  No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we aim to use reasonable safeguards.
  
  9. Children’s privacy
  This extension is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.
  
  10. Changes to this policy
  We may update this policy. We’ll update the “Effective date” and post the new version at the same URL. Your continued use means you accept the changes.
  
  11. Contact
  Questions, complaints, or data requests:
  
  Email: devansh.vora1929@gmail.com
  
  
  Data Deletion Instructions
  If you want us to delete any data we’ve stored on our servers:
  
  Email devansh.vora1929@gmail.com with subject “Delete my Email Sorter AI data”.
  
  Include the Google account email you used with the extension.
  
  We will delete cached summaries/labels/drafts and confirm within 30 days.
  
  You can also:
  
  Revoke Gmail access (https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).
  
  Uninstall the extension.
  
  Request OpenAI delete associated data via their policies if required.
  
  Google & Chrome Web Store Compliance Notes
  We comply with the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
  
  We only use Gmail data for features directly in the extension; we do not transfer it to unrelated services.
  
  We comply with the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy: we request the minimum scopes needed, and data is not sold.
